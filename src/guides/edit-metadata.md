# Edit Metadata

In some cases, when you add an item to your Library, information such as summaries or release date is retrieved from embedded metadata. These details are shown when viewing the item to provide information about the item and make using Komga a more enjoyable experience.

You may wish to customize or change the information associated with a library item.

## Using the Edit Screen

### Editing Standard Fields, Tags or Authors

### Changing Fields

To edit the details for a particular piece of metadata:

- Choose the tab of category you want to change on the left, then click the detail field
- Type or paste the changes
- For items in the Tags or Authors area, simply start typing the name. If the name already exists in the database, it will appear for you and you can select it. Otherwise, simply type out the name like normal.

To remove an item, click the `X` next to the entry.

### Locking And Unlocking

If you’ve made an edit to a field, it is automatically locked. A locked field will not be altered when an item is refreshed. To lock or unlock a field:

- Edit the field and it will lock automatically
- Click the lock icon to either lock or unlock the field
- A field is locked when the lock icon is colored orange

### Sort Titles

The `Sort Title` field lets you control how items are sorted alphabetically. The `Title` field is what will be displayed, but the `Sort Title` field is used for sorting.

For example, if you want to ignore the article ("The") for your series like "The Boys":

- Find the "The Boys" series and open the Edit Details screen
- Click in the `Sort Title` and type "Boys (The)" then `Save Changes`

The result is that the series "The Boys" will appear together in the list under the letter B and sorted as entered in the `Sort Title` field.

### Sort Numbers

The `Sort Number` field lets you control how items are sorted within a series. The `Number` field is what will be displayed, but the `Sort Number` field is used for sorting.

For example, if you have a "2015 Special" that is between book 24 and 25:

- set the `Number` to "2015 Special"
- set the `Sort Number` to "24.5"

The result is that the special book will appear between book 24 and 25, and will show "2015 Special" as its number.
