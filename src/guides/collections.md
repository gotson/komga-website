# Collections

Collections let you gather related series together. For example, you might add all the Batman series together in a "Batman" collection.

## Adding series to a collection

You can add a Series to a collection from the action menu icon <img src="/assets/media/guides/action-menu-icon.png" style="vertical-align: middle" height="32" /> and click on _Add to collection_.

You can also select multiple series, and click on _Add to collection_.

A dialog will show up, where you can either add series to an existing collection, or create a new collection.

## Finding the Collections

Collections can be discovered or viewed in three ways:
1. Series details screen
2. Viewing the libraries "By Collection"
3. Searching in the search bar

### Series details screen

When viewing the details screen for a specific series that belongs to a collection, the collection will be displayed in a collapsible panel.

Click on the panel to expand it and see the content of the collection.

### Viewing the libraries "By Collection"

Only show collections that exist in the library. Opening a collection goes to the "collection details" screen (see below).

## Collection details

The collections details screen contains all the series that belong to the collection. It can include series from any library. By adding items in different libraries to collections, you can relate them to each other.

### Collection ordering

By default collections will order series by alphabetical sort order. However, you can edit a collection and choose to manually sort series in a collection. You may want to do so if a collection has a specific reading order for example.

Either click on the edit button on the collection card.

Or click on the edit button from the collection details screen.

<img src="/assets/media/guides/collections/collection-edit-button.png" style="vertical-align: middle;max-height:60px" />

A dialog will show up, where you can edit the collection's ordering.

A manually ordered collection will be showing as such in the collection details screen.

### Edit collection elements

From the collection details screen you can edit the elements composing a collection. To do so, click on the corresponding button in the toolbar.

The series cards will show two extra elements:
- a delete button, to remove the series from the collection
- a grip handle, which let you drag and drop series to reorder them (only available when the collection is manually ordered)

Once you are done with your changes, click the tick in the top bar. Click the cross to discard your changes.

## Deleting a collection

To delete a collection, look for the action menu icon <img src="/assets/media/guides/action-menu-icon.png" style="vertical-align: middle" height="32" /> and click on _Delete_.

This will not delete the items in the collection.
