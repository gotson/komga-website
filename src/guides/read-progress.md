# Read progress <Badge text="0.35.0+" />

Komga can track which books you have read, and books that you are currently reading. Reading progress is tracked for each user separately.

## Supported readers

### Webreader

The webreader can track the progress as you read:
- when you open a book that is in progress, the webreader will resume reading where you left it.
- when you finish reading a book, the webreader will mark it as read.

### Tachiyomi

Tachiyomi can track progress of read books, using the Komga tracker. See [here](/guides/tachiyomi.md#track-read-progress) for more details.

## Unread and in progress indicators

The book card will display read progress indicators:
- Unread books will display an orange tick in the top right corner:

## Marking progress manually
