# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I find the log files?

By default (if you haven't changed the configuration), log files are located:
- on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.komga/komga.log`
- on Unix: `~/.komga/komga.log`
- on Docker: in the directory you mounted as `/config`, in a subdirectory called `logs`

## Komga seems slow, how can I check what's going on?

If any activity is going on, an animated yellow bar will appear below the top-left logo. Hover your cursor over the bar to see the details of all pending tasks.

## After installing the Tachiyomi extension `1.2.24` my series are not connected to Komga anymore

Use the __Migrate source__ function of Tachiyomi to migrate the Series to the same Komga source. This will fix your Series.

## How can I sync reading progress with tracker websites?

Komga does not support this outside the box.

You can try [MAL-Sync](https://github.com/MALSync/MALSync) which integrates with Komga and works with MyAnimeList, Kitsu, Anilist and others.

## Tachiyomi cannot connect, but works in WebView

Try disabling the __DNS over HTTPS__ option (in More > Settings > Advanced). From version `1.2.23` the extension will ignore DNS over HTTPS setting.

## How to enable DEBUG or TRACE logs?

### Via an `application.yml`

Add the following key in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
logging.level.org.gotson.komga: DEBUG
```

or

```yaml
logging.level.org.gotson.komga: TRACE
```

### Using the `jar` via the command line

Start the `jar` with the following option:

```shell script
java -jar komga-x.y.z.jar --logging.level.org.gotson.komga=DEBUG
```

or

```shell script
java -jar komga-x.y.z.jar --logging.level.org.gotson.komga=TRACE
```

### Using Docker

Add the following environment variable:

```shell script
LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_GOTSON_KOMGA=DEBUG
```

or

```shell script
LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_GOTSON_KOMGA=TRACE
```

## Webreader double pages are not showing as single page

The double pages feature of the webreader requires image sizes to be available. This feature was added in v`0.51.0`. If your books have been analyzed before that version, you will need to re-analyze them in order for the double pages feature to work properly.

## Migration from H2 to SQLite

:::tip NOTE
The migration feature has been removed starting from `0.81.0`. Use a prior version if you still need to migrate from H2.
:::

The version `0.48.0` is changing the internal database from H2 to SQLite. The change is done transparently.

A migration will be triggered automatically at startup:
- if the H2 database has not been migrated yet
- if the SQLite database is newly created

The regular functions of Komga will not be available during the data transfer (API, webserver, library scanâ€¦).

After a successful migration, a file with the `.imported` extension will be created next to your existing H2 database (for example for the default configuration it would be `~/.komga/database.h2.mv.db.imported`).

By default, the SQLite database will be located in the same location as the H2 database:
- if using the _Jar_: `~/.komga/database.sqlite`
- if using _Docker_: `/config/database.sqlite`

You can customize the location of the SQLite database using the configuration `komga.database.file` or environment variable `KOMGA_DATABASE_FILE`.

The database backup feature introduced in `0.37.0` has been removed. It might be re-added later on using a different logic.

## Komga doesn't start, logs show error message about the database

:::tip
Migrate to `0.48.0` to avoid those issues!
:::

If Komga does not start, and you have this kind of error messages in the logs:

```log
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLNonTransientException: General error: "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Chunk 20221 not found [1.4.200/9]" [50000-200]
```

It means the database is corrupt, and you need to restore from a backup.

Since `0.37.0` Komga has automatic database backups enabled by default. You will find a `database-backup.zip` file in `~/.komga/` (for `jar`) or `/config/` (for `docker`).

1. Make sure Komga is stopped
2. Delete the corrupt database (`database.h2.mv.db`)
3. Unzip `database-backup.zip`, it should contain a `database.h2.mv.db` file
4. Restart Komga

## Media type application/x-7z-compressed is not supported

Your files are compressed using 7zip, which is not supported. Extract your archives and compress them again using the `zip` format.

## ChunkyTNG displays the wrong number for my books

ChunkyTNG is doing a lot of caching, you may need to remove/add your OPDS server to force ChunkyTNG to update.

## My books/series show a different name than the files/folders

Komga automatically import metadata from `EPUB` files and from `ComicInfo.xml` for `cbz`/`cbr`. The imported metadata will override the file/folder name.

## This server has already been claimed

The server cannot be claimed if a user already exists in the database. It can happen when you start Komga for the first time without the `claim` profile as Komga will generate a default user.

You can solve the issue by deleting the database. By default it is located in `~/.komga/database.sqlite`. `~` is your home directory on Unix, and your User profile on Windows.

## Tachiyomi does not show thumbnails

Make sure the URL of your Komga server starts with `http` or `https` **in lowercase**.

## How can I disable the periodic scans?

Configure `KOMGA_LIBRARIES_SCAN_CRON` / `komga.libraries-scan-cron` to `-`. See [here](/installation/configuration.md#komga-libraries-scan-cron-komga-libraries-scan-cron-cron) for more details.

## Scan doesn't pick up new files under mergerfs 

Add `func.getattr=newest` to the options in your `/etc/fstab` entry for the mergerfs volume. By default, mergerfs doesn't update the modified times for everything for performance reasons. This forces it to. In most cases the performance impact is negligible. 

Example:

```shell
/media/user/disk* /media/user/storage fuse.mergerfs defaults,nonempty,allow_other,use_ino,cache.files=off,moveonenospc=true,dropcacheonclose=true,minfreespace=50G,category.create=mfs,func.getattr=newest,fsname=mergerfs 0 0
```
