Even without WAL, this is a good practice for SQLite performance.</p>\n<p>If Komga does not start anymore after the upgrade to 1.23.0, check the logs or the <a href=\"https://komga.org/docs/installation/configuration#local-filesystem-check\">documentation</a>.</p>",

This also restores support for the Pages API, and thus the compatibility with Tachiyomi, or any OPDS-PSE client.</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.9.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Release Notes</a> for more details on all the new features and fixes.</p>",
