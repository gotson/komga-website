            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Komga has been using SQLite to store its data for around 5 years (v0.48.0 - July 2020), and while it works very well most of the time, some users have experienced bottlenecks on some systems.</p>
<p>In order to boost performances, Komga will enable the SQLite <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL</a> mode (Write-Ahead Logging) by default in the near future.</p>
<p>Since WAL does not work over a network filesystem, release <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.23.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.23.0</a> has introduced a startup check to ensure the databases are located on a local filesystem. Even without WAL, this is a good practice for SQLite performance.</p>
<p>If Komga does not start anymore after the upgrade to 1.23.0, check the logs or the <a href="https://komga.org/docs/installation/configuration#local-filesystem-check">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.9.0</a> contains the second feature drop for Ebooks support.</p>
<p>It brings nice additions to the initial release, most notably the read progress will be kept when reading and restored, same as with other books.</p>
<p>The analysis process of EPUB files was also revamped, and some EPUB files that were not analyzed before should be working fine now.</p>
<p>While the first release forced all the EPUB files through the Epub Reader, this release brings back compatibility with the Divina Reader for pre-paginated EPUB files containing only images. This also restores support for the Pages API, and thus the compatibility with Tachiyomi, or any OPDS-PSE client.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Notes</a> for more details on all the new features and fixes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.8.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.8.0</a> is bringing a long awaited feature: <strong>proper eBook support!</strong></p>
<p>Github issue <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/issues/221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#221</a> has been opened for more than 3 years, and has finally been tackled.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know<a href="https://komga.org/blog/ebook-support#what-you-need-to-know" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What you need to know" title="Direct link to What you need to know">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>eBooks behave like any other book in Komga, in regards to series or metadata. You can even mix comic books and ebooks in the same series.</li>
<li>only EPUB format is supported. Other formats will not be supported in the future.</li>
<li>existing EPUB files will be re-analyzed. If you had image-only EPUB, those may not be compatible anymore with third-party clients.</li>
<li>the web EPUB reader is a very first version, and <strong>does not support saving progress</strong>. Read progress saving and restore will come in a future release.</li>
<li>any book in Komga can be read with <a href="https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebPub</a> compatible clients.</li>
<li><strong>There will be issues</strong>. EPUB is a complex format, and many EPUB files are not properly built. Raise issues <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Github</a> for support.</li>

<li>Multiple settings are now configurable from the <a href="https://komga.org/docs/guides/server-settings">Server Settings</a> screen. You may need to cleanup your configuration file and remove deprecated entries.</li>

<li>Background task management has been revamped, and now supports proper parallel executions (configurable in Server Settings).</li>

<ul>
<li>If you run Docker, it is advisable to use the <code>0.x</code> tag instead of <code>latest</code>. You will be able to decide when you want to upgrade, especially if you are updating containers automatically.</li>
<li>Backup your <code>database.sqlite</code>. You can find it in the configuration directory, by default:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>on Windows: <code>%USERPROFILE%/.komga/database.sqlite</code></li>
<li>on Unix: <code>~/.komga/database.sqlite</code></li>
<li>on Docker: in the directory you mounted as <code>/config</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The minimum Java version required will be Java 17:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you run Komga using the <code>jar</code>, you will need to make sure your Java version is sufficient by running <code>java -version</code>.</li>
<li>If you run Komga using Docker, you don't need to do anything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The hashing algorithm for files and pages will change. Previous hashes for files and pages will be deleted. On startup, if hashing is enabled, Komga will re-hash files and pages using the new algorithm.</li>
<li>The default port will be changed from <code>8080</code> to <code>25600</code>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you use Docker, you will need to update your container or compose configuration to expose the new port.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust your reverse proxy settings.</li>
<li>You can still change the port <a href="https://komga.org/docs/installation/configuration#server_port--serverport-port">through configuration</a>.</li>
</ul>
