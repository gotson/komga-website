At that time I didn\'t know much about web development, but building on Vue 2 / Vuetify 2 helped me to build a good-looking UI that has worked quite well so far. It has become however quite difficult to maintain and evolve:\\n- There are practically no tests, meaning bugs can be introduced easily.\\n- There is a lot of duplicated code, mostly due to Vue 2 limitations.\\n- The whole development stack is tedious to work with, again due to what the javascript ecosystem was like in 2019.\\n\\nWhile Vue 3 came out around the end of 2020, it brought so many breaking changes that it\'s practically impossible to migrate a project from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Vuetify itself only came up with its version 3 end of 2022, and even at that time most of the components were not ready yet.\\n\\nThis year I\'ve started to work on a complete rewrite of the UI, using a more recent development stack, but also more experience under my belt.\\n\\nAs of now the foundations are sound and solid, and I\'ve started rewriting the pages one by one. I am also using the rewrite as an opportunity to include feature requests that were difficult to add in the current version of the UI. \\n\\nThere is still quite a lot to do, so as usual I cannot provide any tentative release date, but I really hope this can be done in 2025.

You can even mix comic books and ebooks in the same series.\\n- only EPUB format is supported. Other formats will not be supported in the future.\\n- existing EPUB files will be re-analyzed. If you had image-only EPUB, those may not be compatible anymore with third-party clients.\\n- the web EPUB reader is a very first version, and **does not support saving progress**. Read progress saving and restore will come in a future release.\\n- any book in Komga can be read with [WebPub](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/) compatible clients.\\n- **There will be issues**. EPUB is a complex format, and many EPUB files are not properly built. Raise issues [on Github](https://github.com/gotson/komga/issues/new/choose) for support.\\n\\n## Other recent changes you may have missed\\n\\nIn case you haven\'t kept up with the release notes since version 1.0.0, here are the most significant changes:\\n- Komga is now available as a [desktop app](/docs/installation/desktop), and is available in the [Microsoft Store](/docs/installation/ms-store)\\n- Multiple settings are now configurable from the [Server Settings](/docs/guides/server-settings) screen. You may need to cleanup your configuration file and remove deprecated entries.\\n- Thumbnails size can now be configured in Server Settings.\\n- Background task management has been revamped, and now supports proper parallel executions (configurable in Server Settings).\\n- Komga now has support for [One-Shots](/docs/guides/oneshots).\\n- a [Command Line Interface](/docs/guides/cli) was added to update forgotten password for the admin account."},{"id":"prepare-v1","metadata":{"permalink":"/hr/blog/prepare-v1","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-21-prepare-v1.md","title":"Prepare for v1.0.0","description":"The future v1.0.0 will bring some breaking changes, this guide will help you to prepare for the next major version.","date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"breaking change","permalink":"/hr/blog/tags/breaking-change"},{"inline":true,"label":"upgrade","permalink":"/hr/blog/tags/upgrade"},{"inline":true,"label":"komga","permalink":"/hr/blog/tags/komga"}],"readingTime":1.1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"gotson","title":"Developer of Komga","url":"https://github.com/gotson","imageURL":"https://github.com/gotson.png","key":"gotson","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"prepare-v1","title":"Prepare for v1.0.0","authors":"gotson","tags":["breaking change","upgrade","komga"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"eBook support","permalink":"/hr/blog/ebook-support"}},"content":"The future v1.0.0 will bring some breaking changes, this guide will help you to prepare for the next major version.\\n\\n## Before upgrading\\n\\n- If you run Docker, it is advisable to use the `0.x` tag instead of `latest`. You will be able to decide when you want to upgrade, especially if you are updating containers automatically.\\n- Backup your `database.sqlite`. You can find it in the configuration directory, by default:\\n    - on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.komga/database.sqlite`\\n    - on Unix: `~/.komga/database.sqlite`\\n    - on Docker: in the directory you mounted as `/config`\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n- The minimum Java version required will be Java 17:\\n    - If you run Komga using the `jar`, you will need to make sure your Java version is sufficient by running `java -version`.\\n    - If you run Komga using Docker, you don\'t need to do anything.\\n- The hashing algorithm for files and pages will change. Previous hashes for files and pages will be deleted. On startup, if hashing is enabled, Komga will re-hash files and pages using the new algorithm.\\n- The default port will be changed from `8080` to `25600`:\\n    - If you use Docker, you will need to update your container or compose configuration to expose the new port.\\n    - You may need to adjust your reverse proxy settings.\\n    - You can still change the port [through configuration](/docs/installation/configuration#server_port--serverport-port)."}]}}')}}]);
