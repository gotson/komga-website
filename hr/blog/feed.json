            "content_html": "<p>Komga is 6 years old !</p>\n<p>Back then Komga didn't even have a user interface, and at first it could only be used as a Tachiyomi (now Mihon) source.</p>\n<p>The first version of the UI was only added in October 2019. At that time I didn't know much about web development, but building on Vue 2 / Vuetify 2 helped me to build a good-looking UI that has worked quite well so far. It has become however quite difficult to maintain and evolve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are practically no tests, meaning bugs can be introduced easily.</li>\n<li>There is a lot of duplicated code, mostly due to Vue 2 limitations.</li>\n<li>The whole development stack is tedious to work with, again due to what the javascript ecosystem was like in 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Vue 3 came out around the end of 2020, it brought so many breaking changes that it's practically impossible to migrate a project from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Vuetify itself only came up with its version 3 end of 2022, and even at that time most of the components were not ready yet.</p>\n<p>This year I've started to work on a complete rewrite of the UI, using a more recent development stack, but also more experience under my belt.</p>\n<p>As of now the foundations are sound and solid, and I've started rewriting the pages one by one. I am also using the rewrite as an opportunity to include feature requests that were difficult to add in the current version of the UI.</p>\n<p>There is still quite a lot to do, so as usual I cannot provide any tentative release date, but I really hope this can be done in 2025. Stay tuned!</p>",
