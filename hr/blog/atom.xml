        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Komga is 6 years old !</p>
<p>Back then Komga didn't even have a user interface, and at first it could only be used as a Tachiyomi (now Mihon) source.</p>
<p>The first version of the UI was only added in October 2019. At that time I didn't know much about web development, but building on Vue 2 / Vuetify 2 helped me to build a good-looking UI that has worked quite well so far. It has become however quite difficult to maintain and evolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are practically no tests, meaning bugs can be introduced easily.</li>
<li>There is a lot of duplicated code, mostly due to Vue 2 limitations.</li>
<li>The whole development stack is tedious to work with, again due to what the javascript ecosystem was like in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Vue 3 came out around the end of 2020, it brought so many breaking changes that it's practically impossible to migrate a project from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Vuetify itself only came up with its version 3 end of 2022, and even at that time most of the components were not ready yet.</p>
<p>This year I've started to work on a complete rewrite of the UI, using a more recent development stack, but also more experience under my belt.</p>
<p>As of now the foundations are sound and solid, and I've started rewriting the pages one by one. I am also using the rewrite as an opportunity to include feature requests that were difficult to add in the current version of the UI.</p>
<p>There is still quite a lot to do, so as usual I cannot provide any tentative release date, but I really hope this can be done in 2025. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Komga has been using SQLite to store its data for around 5 years (v0.48.0 - July 2020), and while it works very well most of the time, some users have experienced bottlenecks on some systems.</p>
<p>In order to boost performances, Komga will enable the SQLite <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL</a> mode (Write-Ahead Logging) by default in the near future.</p>
<p>Since WAL does not work over a network filesystem, release <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.23.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.23.0</a> has introduced a startup check to ensure the databases are located on a local filesystem. Even without WAL, this is a good practice for SQLite performance.</p>
<p>If Komga does not start anymore after the upgrade to 1.23.0, check the logs or the <a href="https://komga.org/hr/docs/installation/configuration#local-filesystem-check">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.9.0</a> contains the second feature drop for Ebooks support.</p>
<p>It brings nice additions to the initial release, most notably the read progress will be kept when reading and restored, same as with other books.</p>
<p>The analysis process of EPUB files was also revamped, and some EPUB files that were not analyzed before should be working fine now.</p>
<p>While the first release forced all the EPUB files through the Epub Reader, this release brings back compatibility with the Divina Reader for pre-paginated EPUB files containing only images. This also restores support for the Pages API, and thus the compatibility with Tachiyomi, or any OPDS-PSE client.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/1.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Notes</a> for more details on all the new features and fixes.</p>]]></content>

<li>any book in Komga can be read with <a href="https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebPub</a> compatible clients.</li>
<li><strong>There will be issues</strong>. EPUB is a complex format, and many EPUB files are not properly built. Raise issues <a href="https://github.com/gotson/komga/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Github</a> for support.</li>

<ul>
<li>If you run Docker, it is advisable to use the <code>0.x</code> tag instead of <code>latest</code>. You will be able to decide when you want to upgrade, especially if you are updating containers automatically.</li>
<li>Backup your <code>database.sqlite</code>. You can find it in the configuration directory, by default:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>on Windows: <code>%USERPROFILE%/.komga/database.sqlite</code></li>
<li>on Unix: <code>~/.komga/database.sqlite</code></li>
<li>on Docker: in the directory you mounted as <code>/config</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The minimum Java version required will be Java 17:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you run Komga using the <code>jar</code>, you will need to make sure your Java version is sufficient by running <code>java -version</code>.</li>
<li>If you run Komga using Docker, you don't need to do anything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The hashing algorithm for files and pages will change. Previous hashes for files and pages will be deleted. On startup, if hashing is enabled, Komga will re-hash files and pages using the new algorithm.</li>
<li>The default port will be changed from <code>8080</code> to <code>25600</code>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you use Docker, you will need to update your container or compose configuration to expose the new port.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust your reverse proxy settings.</li>
<li>You can still change the port <a href="https://komga.org/hr/docs/installation/configuration#server_port--serverport-port">through configuration</a>.</li>
