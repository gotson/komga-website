# Read with Komic

[Komic](https://pruizlezcano.github.io/komic/) is an elegant, feature-rich iOS app designed to give you the best reading experience with your Komga server.

## Adding your Komga server to Komic

The first time you open Komic, you will be prompted to add a server. Enter your _server address_, _username_, and _password_.

Tap _Check connection_ to verify that Komic can connect to your Komga server. If the connection is successful, you will see the Komic's main screen with your library.

:::warning
Apple doesn't let you access unencrypted traffic for non-browser apps outside your local network. This means that if you want to use Komic with your Komga server outside your local network, you need to ensure that your server is accessible over HTTPS.

You can modify your server settings at any time by going to the _Settings_ tab and selecting _Komga Server_.
