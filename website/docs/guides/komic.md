Tap "Check connection" to verify that Komic can connect to your Komga server. If the connection is successful, you will see the Komic's main screen with your library.

:::warning
Apple doesn't let you access unencrypted traffic for non-browser apps outside your local network. This means that if you want to use Komic with your Komga server outside your local network, you need to ensure that your server is accessible over HTTPS.

You can modify your server settings at any time by going to the "Settings" tab and selecting "Komga Server".
