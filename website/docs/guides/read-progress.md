# Read progress

Komga can track which books you have read, and books that you are currently reading. Reading progress is tracked for each user separately.

## Supported readers

The webreader can track the progress as you read:
- when you open a book that is in progress, the webreader will resume reading where you left it.
- when you finish reading a book, the webreader will mark it as read.

CDisplayEx [syncs read status and reading progress](cdisplayex.md#reading-status).

### KOReader

KOReader can [sync read status and reading progress](koreader.md#read-progress-sync).
