# Deprecation


## To be removed in 2.0.0

The following API endpoints will be removed in version `2.0.0`.

### PUT /api/v1/libraries/\{libraryId}

Deprecated since version: `1.3.0`

Use `PATCH /api/v1/libraries/{libraryId}` instead, without any change needed. The `PUT` endpoint redirects to the `PATCH` endpoint internally.

The endpoint now accepts a partial DTO, and will only update fields that are present.
