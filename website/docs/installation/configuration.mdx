# Configuration options

:::info
Komga has sensible default values for all configuration keys. You only need to configure it if you want to change the default behaviour.

The `application.yml` file does not exist by default, you need to create one if you want to customize the configuration.

:::

Komga relies heavily on [Spring Boot's configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html), leveraging `profiles` and configuration `properties`.

The easiest way to configure is either via environment variables (a good fit for `docker` and `docker compose`) or by using an `application.yml` file located in the configuration directory:

- The Docker image will load any `application.yml` file located in the `/config` mounted folder.
- The Jar will load any `application.yml` file located in the `komga.config-dir` directory (defaults to `~/.komga`, [more details](#komga_configdir--komgaconfig-dir-directory)).

Each configuration key can have a different format depending if it's from the environment variable, or from the `application.yml` file. In the following section both format will be provided in the form `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` / `application-property`.

You can also specify configuration via the command line, when launching the `jar`. Use the `application-property` form, and prefix with `--`. For example:

```shell
java -jar komga.jar --server.servlet.context-path="/komga" --server.port=8443
```

:::tip
To convert a property name to an environment variable name you can follow these rules:
- Replace dots `.` with underscores `_`
- Remove any dashes `-`
- Convert to uppercase

For example, the configuration property `server.servlet.context-path` would be an environment variable named `SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXTPATH`.
:::

## Optional configuration

You can use some optional configuration keys:

#### KOMGA_CONFIGDIR / komga.config-dir: `<directory>`

The Komga configuration directory. Will be used to store the logs, database, and any other file Komga needs.

Defaults to:
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Komga` on the _Windows app_. That folder is virtualized by Windows. 
- `~/Library/Application Support/Komga` on the macOS app. 
- `~/.komga` otherwise.

`~` is your home directory on Unix, and your User profile on Windows.

_When overriding this configuration, you need to use `${user.home}` instead of `~` (this is a specific Spring Boot variable)._

#### SERVER_PORT / server.port: `<port>`

Port to listen to for the API and web interface.

Can also be configured from the [Server Settings](/guides/server-settings.md#server-port).

Defaults to `25600`.

#### SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXTPATH / server.servlet.context-path: `<baseUrl>`

Base URL, useful if you need to reverse proxy with a subfolder.

Can also be configured from the [Server Settings](/guides/server-settings.md#base-url).

Defaults to `/`.

#### SERVER_SERVLET_SESSION_TIMEOUT / server.servlet.session.timeout: `<duration>`

The duration after which an inactive session will expire. You can specify the timeunit, for example `14d` for 14 days, or `24h` for 24 hours. If no unit is set, seconds will be used.

Defaults to 30 minutes.

#### KOMGA_DATABASE_FILE / komga.database.file: `<file path>`

File path for the main SQLite database.

If you want to change the directory, it is advised to change `komga.config-dir` instead.

Defaults to:
- `/config/database.sqlite` for _Docker_.
- `\${komga.config-dir}/database.sqlite` otherwise.

#### KOMGA_TASKSDB_FILE / komga.tasks-db.file: `<file path>`

File path for the tasks SQLite database.

If you want to change the directory, it is advised to change `komga.config-dir` instead.

Defaults to:
- `/config/tasks.sqlite` for _Docker_.
- `\${komga.config-dir}/tasks.sqlite` otherwise.

#### KOMGA_CORS_ALLOWEDORIGINS / komga.cors.allowed-origins: `<origins>`

A list of origins to allow for CORS.

Defaults to empty list.

#### KOMGA_OAUTH2ACCOUNTCREATION / komga.oauth2-account-creation: `<true/false>`

A boolean indicating whether Komga should create new users when a login via OAuth2/OIDC succeeds, but there is no existing user with that email.

Such users will be created with a random password, which the user can subsequently change from the _Account Settings_ page later on, for example to be able to connect using OPDS or Mihon.

:::warning
It is recommended to enable this only with OAuth2 providers you control
:::

Defaults to `false`.

#### KOMGA_OIDCEMAILVERIFICATION / komga.oidc-email-verification: `<true/false>`

A boolean indicating whether Komga should check whether the `email_verified` claim is present and true in the OpenID Connect request.

:::warning
It is recommended to disable this only with OIDC providers that do not verify emails (like Azure AD)
:::

Defaults to `true`.

#### LOGGING_FILE_NAME / logging.file.name: `<logfile name>`

Name of the log file.

If you want to change the directory, it is advised to change `komga.config-dir` instead.

Defaults to:
- `~/Library/Logs/Komga/komga.log` for the _macOS app_.
- `/config/logs/komga.log` for _Docker_.
- `\${komga.config-dir}/komga.log` otherwise.

`~` is your home directory on Unix, and your User profile on Windows.

_When overriding this configuration, you need to use `${user.home}` instead of `~` (this is a specific Spring Boot variable)._

## Sample configuration file

Here is a sample `application.yml` file in case you need to customize it. **Only keep the lines you need.**

```yaml
# Only keep lines that are relevant to you!
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Make sure indentation is correct (2 spaces at every indentation level), yaml is very sensitive!
komga:
  database:
    file: ${user.home}/.komga/database.sqlite
  cors.allowed-origins:
    - http://localhost:8081
    - http://localhost:8082
server:
  port: 25600
  servlet:
    session.timeout: 7d # session timeout, here 7 days
    context-path: /komga
```

## Databases configuration

Komga uses 2 SQLite databases:
- a main database to store all the data
- a tasks database to store background tasks

### Local filesystem check

:::warning
SQLite [should not be used on network filesystems](https://sqlite.org/useovernet.html) like CIFS or NFS. Always use a local filesystem for the databases.
:::

Komga will perform a check on startup to ensure that the databases are on a local filesystem, and will stop if it is not the case.

**If you know what you are doing**, the local filesystem check can be disabled using:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="yaml" label="application.yml" default>
        ```yml
        komga:
          database.check-local-filesystem: false
          tasks-db.check-local-filesystem: false
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="env" label="Environment variable">
        ```shell
        KOMGA_DATABASE_CHECKLOCALFILESYSTEM=FALSE
        KOMGA_TASKSDB_CHECKLOCALFILESYSTEM=FALSE
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Fine tuning

Configuration keys are available for each of the database to allow fine tuning:

```yaml
komga:
  # the main database
  database:
    # sets the retry timeout when SQLITE_BUSY error happens
    busy-timeout: 30s
    
    # changes the journal mode
    # accepted values are: DELETE, TRUNCATE, PERSIST, MEMORY, WAL, OFF
    # most likely to be set to wal if needed, check https://sqlite.org/wal.html for more details
    journal-mode: wal
    
    # pool size will determine the number of connections in the pool
    # this takes precedence over max-pool-size if set
    # defaults to undefined
    pool-size: 1
    
    # max-pool-size will determine the maximum number of connections in the pool
    # when set, the number of connections is set to the number of available processors capped at max-pool-size
    # defaults to 1
    max-pool-size: 8
    
    # pragmas accepts a list of key/value pairs where:
    # - key is the pragma name (see https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html)
    # - value is the pragma value
    pragmas:
      # here are some example pragmas
      page_size: 4096
      synchronous: NORMAL

  # the tasks database
  tasks-db:
    # can use the same configuration keys as mentioned for the main database
    busy-timeout: 30s
```
