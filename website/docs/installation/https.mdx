# Expose your server

## HTTPS

If you want to open your Komga server outside your local network, it is strongly advised to secure it with `https` (especially due to the use of http basic authentication).

Spring Boot supports `https` out of the box, but you will have to configure it, and `https` is most useful only with valid certificates (not self-signed), which most people don't readily have available.

We recommend using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy, as it supports the automatic generation of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

## Reverse proxy

In order for Komga to work properly behind a reverse proxy, your proxy should set the following upstream headers:
- set or augment the `X-Forwarded-For` header field
- set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header field
- set the `X-Forwarded-Host` header field

Here are some sample configuration on how to configure reverse proxy for Komga.

### Caddy

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="subdomain" label="Subdomain">
        Without a base URL configured in Komga, using a subdomain:

        ```
        komga.yourdomain.com {
            reverse_proxy http://your-komga-server:25600
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="folder" label="Base URL">
        With a base URL configured in Komga:

        ```
        yourdomain.com {
            reverse_proxy /komga/* http://your-komga-server:25600
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
