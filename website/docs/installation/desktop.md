# Install the Desktop application

You can install Komga from the [Download page](https://download.komga.org). Just follow the instructions on the page.

The desktop application is available for Windows and macOS.

## Updating

The application will automatically update itself when a new version is available.

### Windows

The OS itself will check for updates every 8 hours and upgrade the app in the background, even if it's not being used. Users will never see an update prompt.

### macOS

The app will check for updates on startup without blocking the user, and on a schedule whilst the app runs. Once the user agrees, updates will be downloaded and applied in the background ready for the next launch.
